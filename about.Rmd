<font color="black"><font size=4><font face="Cambria"> I am currently a first-year graduate student at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health in the Biostatistics department. I graduated from SUNY Binghamton University with a BS in Biology and Economics in 2017. I am originally from Syracuse, New York, and currently live in New York City while attending Columbia. </font>

##Hobbies and other Interests
<font color="black"><font size=4><font face="Cambria"> Outside of student life, I like to spend my time at the gym (lifting, swimming, recreational sports, even a little boxing) or playing/listening to music (I play drums and guitar!).  
I also love to ski, having raced since I was young. In college, I raced for the Binghamton University ski team. Since graduating, I help out with the coaching staff when I am around. </font>
