<font size=3>I am currently a graduate student at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health in the Biostatistics department. I graduated from SUNY Binghamton University with a BS in Biology and Economics in 2017. I am originally from Syracuse, New York, and currently live in New York City while attending Columbia. Despite living in New York state my whole life, I am a big Boston sports fan! </font>
