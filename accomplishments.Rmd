<font color="black"><font size=4><font face="Cambria"> In the fall of 2017, a group of fellow students and I worked on a descriptive analysis project involving open-source data from a Twitter API called [Followthehastag](http://followthehashtag.com/). Our goal of the project was to use examine individual tweets from a pre-defined period of time using sentiment analysis to get an idea of how twitter users generally feel and if those feelings could be at all attributed to current events of the time. The full project, along with a more in-depth description, can be found [here](https://k-maciejewski.github.io/p8105_final_website/). My collaborators and I used R for data manipulation and analysis. </font>

<font color="black"><font size=4><font face="Cambria"> In the summer of 2016, I was fortunate enough to be a part of a select group of students who participated in the NIH-funded SIBS (Summer Institute for Biostatistics) program hosted at Columbia University. As part of the program, I was able to work as a mentee under [Dr. Christine Mauro, PhD](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/cmm2212) on part of her ongoing research, which examined the effect of legalizing medical marijuana on total marijuana consumption throuhgout the United States during the 2000s and early 2010s. The project used a mixed-effects linear statistical model, relying primarily on SAS programming for data manipulation and modeling. Stratifying by age and gender and keeping state effects fixed, we arrived at the conclusion that legalizing medical marijuana caused a significant increase in total marijuana usage only in the older age group (25 and older, not specific to either gender), which was very interesting! </font>

>Master's level coursework, completed or in progress at the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health:

<font color="black"><font size=4><font face="Cambria">
* Biostatistical Methods I and II: Covers basic hypothesis testing, linear regression, generalized linear models, longitudinal data analysis, and survival analysis.
<br>
* Data Science I and II: Covers Data Wrangling, visualization in R through ggplot2 and other tools, interactive elements with Shiny and FlexDashboard, writing functions, random sampling, and some machine learning.
<br>
* Probability and Statistical Inference: Covers sample space and set theory, conditional probability, discrete and continuous random variables, joint and marginal distributions, exponential family of distributions, variable transformations, moment generating functions, Central Limit Theorem, and estimation.
<br>
* Epidemiology I: Covers basics of infectious disease epidemiology, study designs, generalizability, screening, and causal inference.  
<br>
* Randomized Clinical Trials I: Covers the rules and regulations of conducting a clinical trial from the pre-trial stages up through a Phase IV trial, with heavy emphasis on Phase III trials and the role of randomization. This course culminates in an original Phase II trial proposal.
