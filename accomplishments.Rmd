<font color="black"><font size=4><font face="Cambria"> In the fall of 2017, a group of fellow students and I worked on a descriptive analysis project involving open-source data from a Twitter API called [Followthehastag](http://followthehashtag.com/). Our goal of the project was to use examine individual tweets from a pre-defined period of time using sentiment analysis to get an idea of how twitter users generally feel and if those feelings could be at all attributed to current events of the time. The full project, along with a more in-depth description, can be found [here](https://k-maciejewski.github.io/p8105_final_website/). My collaborators and I used R for data manipulation and analysis. </font>

<font color="black"><font size=4><font face="Cambria"> In the summer of 2016, I was fortunate enough to be a part of a select group of students who participated in the NIH-funded SIBS (Summer Institute for Biostatistics) program hosted at Columbia University. As part of the program, I was able to work as a mentee under [Dr. Christine Mauro, PhD](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/cmm2212) on part of her ongoing research, which examined the effect of legalizing medical marijuana on total marijuana consumption throuhgout the United States during the 2000s and early 2010s. The project used a mixed-effects linear statistical model, relying primarily on SAS programming for data manipulation and modeling. Stratifying by age and gender and keeping state effects fixed, we arrived at the conclusion that legalizing medical marijuana caused a significant increase in total marijuana usage only in the older age group (25 and older, not specific to either gender), which was very interesting! </font>
